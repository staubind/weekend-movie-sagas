# Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

This purpose of this project is to practice using Sagas. I created a site that lets users inspect a list of movies and click on them to see more details. Users can also add their own movie. This is accomplished through React, Redux, Sagas, Express, and PostgreSQL. I added some Material UI to make it a bit more visually appealing. If I have time I'll come back to it to practice styling, but it's the functionality that was most important to me.
